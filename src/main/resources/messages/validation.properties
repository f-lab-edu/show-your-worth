# This project's spring boot version is quite old.
# It seems not to be applicable in yml(I guess it's available from 3.0.1).
# So I try to write in validation.properties.

policies.accountId.notblank= 아이디 입력은 필수에요.
policies.accountId.pattern.regexp= ^[A-Za-z0-9]{6,15}$
policies.accountId.pattern.errormessage= 아이디는 영문과 숫자 조합 6~15자로 입력해주세요.
